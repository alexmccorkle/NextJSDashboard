## Next.js Christmas Practice

Will be messing around trying to create a dashboard where user's can submit a text, and have it scored for how likely it is that it is AI-generated.

Admin's can see user uploads and scores and flag(?) uploads.

User's can upload or write in text and receive a score for AI probability that is saved to DB.
User can also manage uploads (CRUD)
